# Image-Caption-Generator
This project is a web application that generates natural language captions for uploaded images using a pre-trained model from Hugging Face (vit-gpt2-coco-en). Built with Streamlit, it allows users to interactively upload images and get meaningful descriptions generated by state-of-the-art vision-language models.
