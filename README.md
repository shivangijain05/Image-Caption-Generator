# Image-Caption-Generator
This project is a web application that generates natural language captions for uploaded images using a pre-trained model from Hugging Face (vit-gpt2-coco-en). Built with Streamlit, it allows users to interactively upload images and get meaningful descriptions generated by state-of-the-art vision-language models. 

# 🖼️ Image Caption Generator using Hugging Face & Streamlit

This project is a simple web application that automatically generates descriptive captions for uploaded images. It uses a pre-trained VisionEncoderDecoder model (`ydshieh/vit-gpt2-coco-en`) from the Hugging Face Transformers library and is built using Streamlit.

## 🚀 Demo

Upload an image, and the app will return a natural language description of the image content.

---

## 📦 Features

- Upload `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` images  
- Generates a descriptive caption using a powerful image-to-text transformer model  
- Clean and interactive UI powered by Streamlit

---

## 🧠 Model

The model used is [`ydshieh/vit-gpt2-coco-en`](https://huggingface.co/ydshieh/vit-gpt2-coco-en), a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with GPT2 decoder fine-tuned on the COCO dataset for image captioning.
